==================
Changes in z3c.dav
==================

1.0b2
=====

- Be more pedantic in parsing `IF' conditional header. Raise `BadRequest'
  exception when no conditions are present in the header. Handle condition
  when there are no state tokens known by the system, here the conditional
  request should fail.

- Improved the handling of `Unauthorized' and `Forbidden' errors during the
  processing of `PROPFIND' requests. Basically we return a `Unauthorized'
  response requesting the user to log-in when the problem occurs on the
  requested resource otherwise we render the problem into the `multistatus'
  response. In the case where we aren't allowed to list a folder we ignore
  the contents, unless it is the requested resource.

- Register views for the `zope.security.interfaces.Forbidden' exceptions.

- Remove all the deprecation warnings.

==================
Changes in z3c.dav
==================

1.0b2
=====

- Improved the handling of `Unauthorized' and `Forbidden' errors during the
  processing of `PROPFIND' requests. Basically we return a `Unauthorized'
  response requesting the user to log-in when the problem occurs on the
  requested resource otherwise we render the problem into the `multistatus'
  response. In the case where we aren't allowed to list a folder we ignore
  the contents, unless it is the requested resource.

- Register views for the `zope.security.interfaces.Forbidden' exceptions.

1.0b1
=====

- Fix bug in COPY / MOVE methods when the destination URL contained quoted
  characters - https://bugs.launchpad.net/z3c.dav/+bug/163150

- MKCOL and PROPFIND methods needed to expect a string as a value for the
  content-length header - https://bugs.launchpad.net/z3c.dav/+bug/163153

0.9.1
=====

- stricter property validation

- some servers pass the `Content-Length` header value as a string

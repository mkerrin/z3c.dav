Miscellaneous
=============

The *zope.webdav* package needs to be split up into *zope.webdav* and
*zope.app.webdav*. This is because there are a lot of stuff in here that
is Zope3 specific and when migrating this to Zope2 we don't need them. I
started this process but gave up after a while. Hence we have the
z3-configure.zcml file. This should be a basis for *zope.app.webdav*.

We need better integration with Zope3. That includes providing better support
for caching (ETags), and all the "IF*" headers defined in the HTTP and WebDAV
specs. Also the exceptions and there views are not neccessarly WebDAV specific
so they could maybe be moved into there own package. So developers of other
related packages can re-use them. Note that this will probable require some
rewrite of the current exceptions if this is ever going to happen.

Error Handling
--------------

- write a error widget for the Forbidden exception.

- more documentation.

- I added a `propertyname' to the IDAVException interface. This seems a bit
  random now and should be taught over.

- Add support for setting the pre/post condition XML elements within a
  a error multi-status view. See section 16 in
  draft-ietf-webdav-rfc2518bis-15.txt. Still will probable result in spliting
  up the webdav exceptions. For example AlreadyLocked breaks up into two
  exceptions. One for when the the object is locked and the other for when
  the object is locked but the supplied lock request uri doesn't match the
  current lock token request uri annotation.

- Finish the support for setting the responsedescription XML element within
  the multi-status elements.

Locking
-------

- update the timeout header parsing to support multiple arguments.

- shared lock tokens need testing.

- test locking default timeout - this is an application specific problem. So
  the IDAVLockmanager should be dealing with accepting or rejecting the
  requested timeout.

- lock on unmapped urls doesn't work yet. Zope3 will need to be changed
  to get this to work.

- more unit tests. Names on lockingutils.DAVActiveLock,
  lockingutils.DAVLockdiscovery. In locking the UNLOCK, LOCK method needs
  testing.

Misc
----

- Unicode handling - make sure that this works has it is supposed to.

- allow configuring certain parts of the WebDAV protocol like default timeouts
  on locks, and allowing depth = infinity on PROPFIND requests via ZCML.

- the option request handler needs to be fixed.

- propfind, proppatch - if any property update, view goes horrible wrong then
  a 500 status code needs to be updated.

- egg support

Finally
=======

XXX's - all these need to be removed.
